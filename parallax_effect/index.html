            <p class="text">
                  Hello, My name is Pushkar and I am just an avid consumer of popular
                  storytelling mediums like novels, films, manga, anime, tv shows and
                  graphic novels.
                  <br /><br />
                  Stories can also evoke feelings within us, whether we know the
                  individual or not. Good stories can make us feel excitement, anger,
                  sadness, empathy, or enthusiasm. Our emotional reaction can mean we
                  feel something towards the person telling the story, which helps
                  create connection.
                  <br /><br />
                  This is a list of my favourite pieces of storytelling.

              <h2 class="desc">RED RISING SAGA</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
              Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The
              Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved
              his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything
              to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to
              survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest
              warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the
              revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.
              <br /><br />
              When I started reading this I did not expected it to be this good. I
              love how each book is much better than the previous one. Darrow is my
              favourite fictional protagonist and the cast is top- tier as well. I
              am not ready to say goodbye to this story in the last book.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
              "Mr. Robot" follows Elliot (Rami Malek), a young programmer who works
              as a cyber-security engineer by day and a vigilante hacker by night.
              Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious leader
              (Christian Slater) of an underground hacker group recruits him to
              destroy the corporation he is paid to protect.
              <br /><br />
              As a Computer Science student this was a great experience for me, Rami
              Malek totally nailed the role of Elliot and how the plot develops and
              progress with each and every single episode is masterful love this
              series very much.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
              Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of the world’s most popular TV
              show, is supposed to be an everyman. The Truman Show is set in an
              island town, Seahaven, that evokes the prefab conformities of American
              suburbia. Truman is a brand in a setting that is stridently generic.
              Since his birth, he has navigated a world manufactured—by Christof,
              the creator of his show—for lucrative inoffensiveness. Everything
              around him exists to fulfill the primary mandate of a mass-market TV
              show: appealing to the widest possible audience.
              <br /><br />
              This is the 1st movie that I gave a full score that is 10/10. The
              whole concept of the movie is just simply fascinating to me and the
              ending or closing scence moves me too much.
              <br /><br />Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon,
              good evening, and good night!

          </div>
            <p class="text">
              12 Angry Men is a 1957 film about a jury of 12 men who deliberate the
              fate of a teenager accused of murder. The jurors must put aside their
              personal conflicts to reach a verdict. The case involves a teenager
              accused of stabbing his father to death. If convicted, the boy will be
              sentenced to death.
              <br /><br />
              This is probably the most thrilling 97 mins I have experienced while
              watching a movie. Each and every dialouge and performances by the
              actors is just phenomenal.

            <h2 class="desc">BOJACK HORSEMAN</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            A Netflix original about a former sitcom star attempting a comeback
            while also dealing with addiction and depression, BoJack Horseman
            followed an anthropomorphic horse who continually tried to dull the
            pain of his previous bad behavior with something worse. As the show
            grew in scope and fleshed out a large cast of characters, it explored
            all kinds of ideas and stories.
            <br /><br />
            Seeing how Bojack is evolving and trying to get better as a person was
            very imapactful and thought provoking, the re-watch in the laters year
            when I have more life experience gonna hit hard. The cast is amazing
            as well with a phenomenal conclusion. Couldn't have asked for anything
            more.
